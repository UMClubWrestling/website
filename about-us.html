        <h1 class="center">About the Team</h1>
        <p class="lead center">The Club Wrestling team is a team that competes in the <a href="https://ncwa.net/">NCWA</a> along with the varsity teams from many other schools. We compete across the United States, with our nationals competition previously being held in Florida and Texas. We try to host several home meets each year, which is done in Cliff Keen Arena, the same place that Varsity Athletics will use for Varsity matches. We have several practices each week, where we learn new moves, practice our techniques, and improve our conditioning.</p>

                <h2>Outside of Wrestling</h2>
                <p>In addition to our practices and our competitions, the club also gets together frequently outside of practice. We organize and participate in several community service events each semester. Some of our previous community service events have been helping out in Nichols Arboretum and Matthaei Botanical Gardens, raising money for Toys for Tots, raking leaves for elderly citizens, and many more. We've helped to remove invasive species and clean up the arboretum for the good of the commuinity.</p>
                <p>We also organize several social events each semester. Our team has hosted tailgates before football games, a team formal, and several team dinners. The social events have brought several of our members close enough to share a house together at the university.</p>

                <h2>Bahna Wrestling Center</h2>
                <p>Practices are held at Bahna Wrestling Center, the same multimillion dollar facility that varsity wrestling uses for their practices. We are very fortunate for the facility and thank Varsity Wrestling for being so generous.</p>
